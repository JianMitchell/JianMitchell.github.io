        <h2>The Waterfall Methodology</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The Waterfall methodology is one of the earliest approaches that was structured for
                software
                development. Basically, the methodology was introduced by Winston Royce in 1970 to
                design
                software through a model that followed a linear and sequential process. Furthermore,
                it was made in relation to a cascading waterfall where it flowed in distinct phases
                downwards.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each phase within the Waterfall model was required to be accomplished before the
                next
                phase began. Therefore, making the structure rigid in that it prevented minimal
                overlap
                between stages, providing well-defined requirements and minimal changes to projects
                that
                emphasized comprehensive documentation at each stage, thus creating a clear trail of
                the
                development process.
            </p>

            <p>
                While modern development practices introduced flexible alternatives, the Waterfall
                model remains relevant due to its strict regulatory compliance. For example, it is
                still used in aerospace, healthcare systems, and government projects, which require
                its
                predictability and documentation for clear visibility into timelines and
                deliverables
                for a projects flow to shareholders.

        <h2>Sequential Phases</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><span class="highlight">Requirements Analysis:</span>
                This phase produces a detailed specification through gathering and documenting all
                system
                requirements. Basically, shareholders influence the design requirements and this is
                translated towards guiding the entire projects structure.
            </li>

            <li><span class="highlight">System Design:</span>
                This phase creates an architectural blueprint over the specified requirements. This
                is where
                the designers develop the database, interface, and system architecture diagrams for
                the
                project.
            </li>

            <li><span class="highlight">Implementation:</span>
                This phase is where developers write code based on the designs specifications. This
                is where
                the design would start forming functional software components.
            </li>

            <li><span class="highlight">Testing:</span>
                This phase is where everything done so far is checked under quality assurance.
                Basically,
                teams of individuals would verify through unit, integration, and system tests
                that the software meets all the requirements.
            </li>

            <li><span class="highlight">Deployment:</span>
                This phase is where the system is officially deployed to the public. The system by
                this
                point would be completed and installed within a production environment available to
                end
                users.
            </li>

            <li><span class="highlight">Maintenance:</span>
                This phase is where the system gets routine checks. Basically, it mostly involved an
                ongoing support addressing bugs, updates, and minor enhancements to the system after
                its official deployment.

            <summary>Example: Space Systems</summary>
            <p>
                Aerospace institutions or companies use the Waterfall methodology frequently.
                Basically, space missions require software that is rigid in nature due to the
                impossibility of post-launch modifications. Therefore, the Waterfall model makes
                this
                essential due to its meticulously defined requirements, testing, and documentation
                before
                delivery.
