            <h2>Understanding SDLC Methodologies</h2>

            <p>
                The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) represents a structured systematic way of
                building
                software systems. Therefore, various methodologies were built on the premise of
                addressing
                different needs based on a projects structure, team dynamics, and business
                requirements
                to implement software systems efficiently and robustly.
            </p>

            <p>
                This website will explore some of the fundamental SDLC methodologies that are
                currently
                prevalent today in Computer Science. Each approach offers different ways of handling
                software systems, while having advantages and disadvantages based on time,
                efficiency
                and the approach in the development of software.

                <summary>Why SDLC Matters</summary>
                <p>
                    SDLC methodologies are the core frameworks that determine a projects
                    implementation.
                    Basically, it effectively determines whether something gets delivered faster or
                    slower
                    based on a pre-determined approach on handling software systems. These
                    established
                    processes determine the requirements for gathering, designing, implementing,
                    testing,
                    and maintaining a projects flow to ensure company expectations.
