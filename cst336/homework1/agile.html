    <h2>The Agile Methodology</h2>

    <img src="img/agile-methodology.png" alt="Agile development cycle">

    <blockquote>
      <em>"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Working software over
        comprehensive documentation."</em>
      <cite>— The Agile Manifesto</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <article class="two-column">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The Agile methodology emerged within the early 2000s, which was created due to the
        limitations of the SDLC approaches at that given time period. Therefore, The Agile
        Manifesto was signed in collaboration with seventeen software developers in 2001,
        emphasizing and establishing core values such as adaptability, collaboration, and
        customer satisfaction over rigid planning and documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to prior approaches that emphasized the implementation of an entire projects plan
        within its first phase, the Agile model breaks the development into iterations called sprints.
        Basically, these sprints last between-two-to-four weeks through software increments, which
        help development teams gather feedback early to readjusted their approach in the usage of the
        software and its changing requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Agile methodology prioritizes face-to-face communication, continuous shareholder
        engagement, and rapid response to change. Therefore, needing daily meetings, sprint
        planning sessions, and retrospectives to constantly align teams towards maintaining
        flexibility. This approach has become the leading methodology in modern software
        development for web applications, mobile apps, and products that require frequent
        updates.

    <h2>Agile Frameworks and Practices</h2>

    <div class="features">
      <div class="feature-box">
        <h4>Scrum</h4>
        <p>
          This is one of the most popular Agile frameworks, as it provides defined roles for
          development teams, sprints, and ceremonies that would regularly allow for daily
          communication, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives. In the end, Scrum
          provides developers with a well-founded structure, while maintaining flexibility.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-box">
        <h4>Kanban</h4>
        <p>
          This framework is for a visual workflow management system that continuously delivers
          without fixed iterations. Basically, a project manager used to establish milestones
          through work-in-progress limits that prevent bottlenecks in production. In the end,
          Kanban is meant for maximum flexibility for development teams handling various workloads.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-box">
        <h4>Extreme Programming (XP)</h4>
        <p>
          This framework is focused on technical practices derived from test development, pair
          programming, continuous integration, and refactoring. Basically, the very idea behind
          this one is to be not only fluent in development, but excel through disciplined
          engineering practices.

    <h2>Agile Best Practices</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">User Stories:</span>
        This practice is meant to provide developers a new perspective. Basically, users of their
        system can voice requirements based on their personal wants and how it would benefit
        the development of the system in the long run.
      </li>

      <li><span class="highlight">Definition of Done:</span>
        This practice is reminiscent of project management systems, as it dictates clear criteria
        before the work is considered complete, thus ensuring quality standards and requirements.
      </li>

      <li><span class="highlight">Continuous Integration:</span>
        This practice helps developers integrate code into repositories like GitHub, which helps
        automate builds and creates a testing environment for issues early on.
      </li>

      <li><span class="highlight">Velocity Tracking:</span>
        This practice is used to measure the teams output through sprints, which is essentially
        a record of improvement and prediction on future accuracy and capacity.
      </li>

      <li><span class="highlight">Burndown Charts:</span>
        This practice is used to provide a visual representation on what work is completed against
        the amount of time it took to accomplish. Basically, this is mostly used to stay on track
        during sprints.
      </li>

      <li><span class="highlight">Product Backlog:</span>
        This practice prioritizes a list of features, enhancements, and fixes. Basically, a guide
        that showcases the progression through written files or time stamps on the development of
        the software.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <details>
      <summary>Example: Agile Transformation</summary>
      <p>
        Companies can develop Agile scaling models with autonomous groups organized through guilds.
        Basically, a squad of developers can operate like a mini-startup with end-to-end
        responsibility for specific features, which means that each organized group under a certain
        division/guild, can work on certain structures that can eventually be pieced together like a
        puzzle for the final system. Therefore, the Agile scaling models emphasize autonomy, alignment,
        and continuous improvement, providing flexibility and constant improvement.
