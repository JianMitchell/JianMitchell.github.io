    <h2>The Waterfall Methodology</h2>

    <img src="img/waterfall-methodology.png" alt="Detailed waterfall model diagram">

    <article class="two-column">
      <p>
        The Waterfall methodology is one of the earliest approaches that was structured for software
        development. Basically, the methodology was introduced by Winston Royce in 1970 to design
        software through a model that followed a linear and sequential process. Furthermore,
        it was made in relation to a cascading waterfall where it flowed in distinct phases downwards.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each phase within the Waterfall model was required to be accomplished before the next
        phase began. Therefore, making the structure rigid in that it prevented minimal overlap
        between stages, providing well-defined requirements and minimal changes to projects that
        emphasized comprehensive documentation at each stage, thus creating a clear trail of the
        development process.
      </p>

      <p>
        While modern development practices introduced flexible alternatives, the Waterfall
        model remains relevant due to its strict regulatory compliance. For example, it is
        still used in aerospace, healthcare systems, and government projects, which require its
        predictability and documentation for clear visibility into timelines and deliverables
        for a projects flow to shareholders.

    <h2>Sequential Phases</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><span class="highlight">Requirements Analysis:</span>
        This phase produces a detailed specification through gathering and documenting all system
        requirements. Basically, shareholders influence the design requirements and this is
        translated towards guiding the entire projects structure.
      </li>

      <li><span class="highlight">System Design:</span>
        This phase creates an architectural blueprint over the specified requirements. This is where
        the designers develop the database, interface, and system architecture diagrams for the
        project.
      </li>

      <li><span class="highlight">Implementation:</span>
        This phase is where developers write code based on the designs specifications. This is where
        the design would start forming functional software components.
      </li>

      <li><span class="highlight">Testing:</span>
        This phase is where everything done so far is checked under quality assurance. Basically,
        teams of individuals would verify through unit, integration, and system tests
        that the software meets all the requirements.
      </li>

      <li><span class="highlight">Deployment:</span>
        This phase is where the system is officially deployed to the public. The system by this
        point would be completed and installed within a production environment available to end
        users.
      </li>

      <li><span class="highlight">Maintenance:</span>
        This phase is where the system gets routine checks. Basically, it mostly involved an
        ongoing support addressing bugs, updates, and minor enhancements to the system after
        its official deployment.

      <summary>Example: Space Systems</summary>
      <p>
        Aerospace institutions or companies use the Waterfall methodology frequently.
        Basically, space missions require software that is rigid in nature due to the
        impossibility of post-launch modifications. Therefore, the Waterfall model makes this
        essential due to its meticulously defined requirements, testing, and documentation before
        delivery.
